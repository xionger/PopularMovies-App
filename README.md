# PopularMovies-App

This is the first android app I made from scratch for Android Developer Nanodegree program. The app fetches data from the Internet with theMovieDB API and presents the movie information to the users.

## Features

* Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.
* Allow user to change sort order via a setting:
  * The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated
  * Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
  * original title
  * movie poster image thumbnail
  * A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
  * user rating (called vote_average in the api)
  * release date
* Allow the user to mark favorite movies locally
